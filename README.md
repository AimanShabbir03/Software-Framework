# Software-Framework
# Angular Framework
In this repository includes the angular framework, in which I included its introduction, selection of framework, architecture evolution, starting from its first release to the current release, mention the release number, major features , architecture diagram, release notes and team contribution. 
Angular is a robust, open-source, front-end web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It is widely used to build dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs). Angular is written in TypeScript, providing a strong typing system and advanced tooling, which helps developers build scalable and maintainable applications.

# Key Features
1. Component-Based Architecture
Applications are built using reusable components that encapsulate logic, templates, and styling.

2. Modules
Angular organizes code into modules, allowing developers to group components, directives, services, and pipes logically.

3. Two-Way Data Binding
Synchronizes data between the model and view automatically, reducing boilerplate code.

5. Dependency Injection (DI)
Angular provides a powerful DI system to manage services and promote modularity.

5. Directives and Pipes
Directives are used to manipulate the DOM, while Pipes transform data in the template.

7. Routing and Navigation
Angular's Router Module enables the creation of SPAs by managing navigation and routing dynamically.

7. Built-In Services
Provides services for handling HTTP requests, forms, and observables (e.g., using RxJS).

9. TypeScript Integration
Offers a modern development experience with features like static typing, interfaces, and decorators.

9. Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation
Converts TypeScript and HTML templates into optimized JavaScript before runtime, improving application performance.

11. Testing Support
Angular includes tools like Karma and Protractor for unit testing and end-to-end testing.
